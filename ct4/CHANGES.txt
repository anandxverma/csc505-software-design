At a high level, the changes include fixing the overall implementation of the Builder-Director pattern. Here is the list of changes:

1. DeveloperBuilder Class

- Added a build() method to construct the Developer object matching the Builder-Director pattern. The method takes the developer's name and experience level as input parameters to create a Developer class object.

- DeveloperBuilder Class - Removed the set_name() and set_experience_level() methods enforcing that these parameters are confined to the build() method.

- Added validations for name and experience level parameters.

- Improved the add_traits_<trait_name>() methods for setting consistent trait values

2. DeveloperBuilderDirector Class

- Updated the method calls to align with changes in the DeveloperBuilder class.

3. Class Diagram

- Updated the class diagram to reflect the changes in the Python Classes.
